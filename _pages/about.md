 <p align="justify" class="pt-3">Shu Jing is a distinguished professor in the school of physics of Peking University, a professor in Institute of Theoretical Physics, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (2022). In 2012, he was selected as young overseas high-level talent and returned to China. In 2019, for his leading research on the breaking of fundamental symmetries in particle physics and cosmology, he received the Asian Achievement Award from the Global Chinese Society of Physics and Astronomy (Robert T. Poe Prize), and he is the youngest recipient of the award so far. In 2020, he was granted by the National Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars.</p>
 
 <p align="justify" class="pt-3">Jing Shu has always focused his research on particle physics and cosmology. According to the INSPIRE high-energy physics database, 76 papers have been published till April of 2022, including 12 papers in Physical Review Letters (PRL) (2 papers selected as the Editorâ€™s Suggestion) and 1 paper in Nature Astronomy. The total citation is more than 4,100 times. Due to his significant progress in the origin of mass of fundamental particles, ultra-light dark matter detection, scattering amplitude and effective field theory, he has been invited to give plenary talks at many international conferences, such as SUSY2015, BLV2015, HEFT2019, HEFT2021, etc. </p>
