<p align="justify" >We propose boosted dark matter (BDM) as a possible explanation for the excess of keV electron recoil events observed by XENON1T. BDM particles have velocities much larger than those typical of virialized dark matter, and, as such, BDM-electron scattering can naturally produce keV electron recoils. We show that the required BDM-electron scattering cross sections can be easily realized in a simple model with a heavy vector mediator...</p>
