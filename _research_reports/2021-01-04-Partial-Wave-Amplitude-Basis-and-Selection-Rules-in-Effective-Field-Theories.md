<p align="justify" >We derive the generalized partial wave expansion for N (M) scattering amplitude in terms of spinor helicity variables. The basis amplitudes of the expansion with definite angular momentum j consist of the PoincarÂ´e Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Moreover, we obtain a series of selection rules that restrict the anomalous dimension matrix of effective operators and how effective operators contribute to some 2 (N) amplitudes at the loop level....</p>
