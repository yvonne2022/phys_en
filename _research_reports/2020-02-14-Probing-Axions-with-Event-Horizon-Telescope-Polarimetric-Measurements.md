<p align="justify" >With high spatial resolution, polarimetric imaging of a supermassive black hole, like M (87 star) or Sgr A(star), by the Event Horizon Telescope can be used to probe the existence of ultralight bosonic particles, such as axions. Such particles can accumulate around a rotating black hole through the superradiance mechanism, forming an axion cloud...</p>
