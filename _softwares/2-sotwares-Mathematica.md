 <p align="justify">Effective field theory (EFT) provides a systematical framework for parametrizing various new physics only based on the field content, the Lorentz invariance, and the gauge symmetries in the standard model(SM). Recently we present a complete list of the dimension 8 operator basis in the standard model effective field theory ( SMEFT) using group theoretic techniques in a systematic and automated way. We adopt a new form of operators in terms of the  irreducible representations of the Lorentz group, and identify the Lorentz structures as states in a SU(N) group. Our algorithm can be easily applied to higher dimensional standard model effective field theory and other effective field theories, making these studies more approachable.</p>

<p align="justify">The whole procedure is implemented and automized by Mathematica, and our code can be easily applied to higher dimensions of SMEFT and other EFTs beyond the SM. In terms of efficiency, listing the dimension 8 operators only cost less than 2 min on a personal laptop.
