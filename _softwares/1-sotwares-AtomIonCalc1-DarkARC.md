<p align="justify">Boosted dark matter represents an attractive class of models containing a fast-moving dark matter particle, which can lead to nonstandard nuclear or electron recoil signals in direct detection experiments. It has been shown that this interpretation successfully explains the excess of keV electron recoil events recently observed by the XENON1T experiment, and that a daily modulation of the signal in the detector is expected.</p> 
				
				
<p align="justify">In our work we investigate the modulation feature in much greater detail and in a more general framework. We perform simulations of the dark matter interactions with electrons in atoms building up the Earth on its path to the detector, and we provide detailed predictions for the expected daily changes in the boosted dark matter signal for various direct detection experiments, including XENON1T, PandaX, and LUX-ZEPLIN. More detailes can be found from the Refs.[1] .</p>

<p align="justify">The software used in this research is publicly available. The ionization form factor is calculated using AtomIonCalc1 , which is refined from the software DarkARC. The software realEarthScatterDM2 is used to simulate the DM propagation inside the Earth, and was independently developed for this research.</p>
