### Quantum field theory (for theoretical physics)


- - -

<p align="justify">In theoretical physics, quantum field theory (QFT) is a theoretical framework that combines classical field theory, special relativity and quantum mechanics. QFT is used in particle physics to construct physical models of subatomic particles and in condensed matter physics to construct models of quasiparticles.</p>

<p align="justify">QFT treats particles as excited states (also called quanta) of their underlying quantum fields, which are more fundamental than the particles. Interactions between particles are described by interaction terms in the Lagrangian involving their corresponding quantum fields. Each interaction can be visually represented by Feynman diagrams according to perturbation theory in quantum mechanics.</p>

<p align="justify">The curriculum of Quantum field theory has the following contents:</p>

+ Chapter 1: Prelude
+ Chapter 2: Canonical Quantization of Fields						        
+ Chapter 3: Symmetry Properties
+ Chapter 4: Interacting Fields and Perturbation Theory
+ Chapter 5:Decay and Lifetime, Scattering and Cross Section
+ Chapter 6: Perturbative Approximation in the Calculation of Certain Physical Processes, and Renormalization
